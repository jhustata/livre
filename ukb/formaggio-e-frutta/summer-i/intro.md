# Preface

Welcome to the [340.600](https://www.jhsph.edu/courses/course/36824/2023/340.600.11/stata-programming) Summer Institute Course in Stata Programming!

This class will be offered in a hybrid-format to cater to both those who will be in-person at the Bloomberg School Wolfe **E2014** (Sommer Hall) and those who will be joining us virtually (Zoom [link](https://jhjhm.zoom.us/j/98481767907)). In-person attendees are encouraged to also log into zoom, which allows students to share code and to collectively `debug`. Students last summer described this as one of the best aspects of their learning experience. 

By contrast, exclusively in-person class formats without the zoom option make it difficult for students to articulate the issues they might be confronting. This makes collective troubleshooting a nightmare. 

Our class will be structured as follows:
   
   + 8:30-9:30 lecture
   + 9:30-10:00 lab
   + 10:00-10:15 break
   + 10:15-11:15 lecture
   + 11:15-11:50 lab     
     
Evaluation of your progress will be done on a daily basis:

   + One graded lab per day (in-class)
   + An optional assignment given at the end of the class
   + We encourage you to do the in-class labs even if you're not taking the class for credit
   + Everyone who turns in every lab + the final assignment (on time) will get an A or a B

Please use the [CoursePlus](https://courseplus.jhu.edu/core/index.cfm/go/home/) Discussion Forum to ask general questions about Stata, course administration, etc. You may email your instructor if you have confidential questions (e.g. grades). 

Zoom protocol will be simple. Everyone but the lecturer will be muted. You are welcome to type questions into the zoom chat window, which we will check every few minutes. **During labs** please post questions and comments to the CoursePlus message board for fellow students to reference. We intend to record and post lectures; but there can be no guarantees. Please watch live if feasible.

A few words on academic integrity. Copying small code snippets from books, the Internet, or classmates is permissible and even encouraged as long as it is accompanied with citation in the comments that may look something like this:

```stata
tokenize `c(ALPHA)'  // Adapted from code at https://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1380433-creating-a-counter-with-alphabets
```

Use of AI including chatGPT as a copilot, guide, or assistant is <u>strongly</u> encouraged during- and long after completion of this course[.](labs.md)
