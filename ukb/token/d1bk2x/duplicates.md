To identify the first redundant URL in the provided HTML code, we need to look for URLs that appear multiple times in the `links` array within the JavaScript section, as these are the URLs associated with the navigation links in the app grid. A redundant URL is one that is repeated across different link entries, potentially leading to duplicated navigation options.

### Analysis
The `links` array contains objects with `name`, `url`, and `icon` properties. We’ll focus on the `url` field to find duplicates. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Extract URLs**: List all URLs from the `links` array.
2. **Identify Duplicates**: Check for URLs that appear more than once.
3. **Determine the First Redundant URL**: Identify the earliest URL in the array that is repeated later.

### Extracted URLs

### Identifying Duplicates
By examining the URLs, we can identify repetitions:

- **https://abikesa.github.io/tokens/** appears 10 times:
  - Index 12 (Tokens)
  - Index 17 (Metis)
  - Index 22 (God)
  - Index 27 (Devil)
  - Index 37 (Trust)
  - Index 42 (Ego)
  - Index 47 (Ganglion)
  - Index 52 (Suspense)
  - Index 57 (Deception)
  - Index 62 (Bayesian)
- **https://abikesa.github.io/the-dude/** appears 9 times:
  - Index 16 (Zeus)
  - Index 21 (Child)
  - Index 26 (Play)
  - Index 31 (Mibala)
  - Index 36 (Amygdala)
  - Index 41 (Id)
  - Index 46 (Axon)
  - Index 51 (Calms)
  - Index 56 (Self)
  - Index 61 (Hume)
- **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abikesa/find/refs/heads/main/dir.sh** appears 2 times:
  - Index 11 (Committee)
  - Index 30 (Fire)
- **../../../ai** appears 2 times:
  - Index 14 (Nietzsche)
  - Index 29 (Matrix)
- **../../../decoy** appears 2 times:
  - Index 19 (Apollo)
  - Index 24 (Harp)

Other URLs, including relative paths like `../../../entropy/`, `../../digestivo/`, etc., and absolute URLs like `https://abikesa.github.io/tactic/`, appear only once.

### Determining the First Redundant URL
The “first redundant URL” refers to the earliest URL in the `links` array (by index) that is repeated later in the array. Let’s examine the earliest occurrences of the duplicated URLs:

- **https://abikesa.github.io/tokens/**: First appears at index 12 (Tokens), repeated at index 17 (Metis) and others.
- **https://abikesa.github.io/the-dude/**: First appears at index 16 (Zeus), repeated at index 21 (Child) and others.
- **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abikesa/find/refs/heads/main/dir.sh**: First appears at index 11 (Committee), repeated at index 30 (Fire).
- **../../../ai**: First appears at index 14 (Nietzsche), repeated at index 29 (Matrix).
- **../../../decoy**: First appears at index 19 (Apollo), repeated at index 24 (Harp).

Among these, the URL with the lowest index is:

- **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abikesa/find/refs/heads/main/dir.sh** at index 11 (Committee), which is repeated at index 30 (Fire).

This URL appears before the others that are duplicated (e.g., `tokens/` at index 12, `the-dude/` at index 16, etc.).

### Verification
To ensure accuracy, we note that no URLs before index 11 are repeated. The URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abikesa/find/refs/heads/main/dir.sh` is the earliest in the array that has a duplicate later (at index 30). While `https://abikesa.github.io/tokens/` and `https://abikesa.github.io/the-dude/` have more repetitions, they appear later in the array (indices 12 and 16, respectively).

### Final Answer
The first redundant URL in the provided HTML code is:

**https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abikesa/find/refs/heads/main/dir.sh**

This URL is first used at index 11 (for “Committee”) and repeated at index 30 (for “Fire”).
