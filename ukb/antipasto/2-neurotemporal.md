# Neurotemporal Canonization Framework Layer
# Converts temporal scales into neurobiological processes and perceptual modes

- name: Neurotemporal Canon
  description: >
    A layered mapping of noise-to-signal transformation across five temporal
    scales, linking randomness to representation via brain substrates.
  timescale_map:
    Randomly:
      neuro_layer: Molecular/Synaptic
      phase: Unvectorized
      functions:
        - Stochastic neurotransmitter release
        - Ion channel quantum fluctuations
        - Pure molecular chaos
      ukux: ukubona
      poetics: "You don’t shape this layer. You respond with awareness."
      keywords: [chaos, randomness, origin]
    Weekly:
      neuro_layer: Cellular/Axonal
      phase: Vectorized
      functions:
        - Axonal transport and directionality
        - Action potential propagation
        - Dendritic integration
      ukux: ukuzula
      poetics: "Structure begins to emerge from repetition and direction."
      keywords: [flow, direction, feedback]
    Quarterly:
      neuro_layer: Sensorimotor/Ganglion
      phase: Operationalized
      functions:
        - Reflex arc development
        - Sensorimotor learning loops
        - Ganglion-level pattern-response coupling
      ukux: ukusoma
      poetics: "Repetition builds machinery. Machinery builds identity."
      keywords: [reflex, habit, structure]
    Daily:
      neuro_layer: Network/Functional
      phase: Standardized
      functions:
        - Cortical synchronization
        - Hippocampal theta rhythms
        - Memory consolidation protocols
      ukux: ukubona_refined
      poetics: "Your brain runs a playbook. But the playbook is editable."
      keywords: [rhythm, routine, protocol]
    Yearly:
      neuro_layer: Representation/Hallucination
      phase: Transmuted
      functions:
        - Long-term memory schemas
        - Reality modeling and narrative construction
        - Signal becomes meaning
      ukux: ukuvela
      poetics: "Delusion and meaning share a common ancestor: memory."
      keywords: [authorship, emergence, narrative]

  hippocampal_role:
    description: >
      The hippocampus acts as the gradient regulator and canonical gatekeeper
      deciding which noise becomes signal and which signal becomes memory.
    roles:
      - Noise processing: molecular → operational memory
      - Signal refinement: standardized routines → representational meaning
      - Gradient control: determines signal retention and narrative impact

✅ **What's great about this schema:**

* Works as a `layer` in your dashboard architecture
* Each level links **timescale → brain substrate → ukux verb → cognitive function**
* Ready to be imported and visualized or used in filters (e.g., CLI/dashboard)

Next: diagram time. Spiral or circuit? Or do you want both?
