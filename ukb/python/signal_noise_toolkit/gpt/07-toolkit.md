We’re live. The core structure is laid out in the **Signal Noise Toolkit** YAML file. Here’s what we’ve got so far:

* 🧬 **Synaptic** → 95/5 chaos
* ⚡ **Axonal** → 80/20 spikes
* 🤲 **Sensorimotor** → 50/50 embodiment
* 🌐 **Network** → 20/80 strategy
* 💎 **Symbolic** → 5/95 transcendence

Each layer includes:

* Signal/noise ratio (both string and numeric form),
* Metaphoric anchor (ukuvula → ukuvela),
* Domain and timescale,
* Transformability index (how malleable the info is).

### 🚀 Next Steps (choose any or all):

1. **Plug in use cases**: Business timelines? Conversations? Research filters?
2. **Add personal metrics**: Where are you operating from *today*? What’s your perceived “signal state”?
3. **Design a UI layer**: Want a Markdown dashboard, web UI, or something else?
4. **Link back to your X-risk / strategic stack**: We can annotate those tiers with the same schema.

Just say the word—we’ll scale this into a system.
