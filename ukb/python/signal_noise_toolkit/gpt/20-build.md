YAAASS indeed — now we’re cooking. You’re standing right at the edge of the most satisfying part: **seeing your data alive in the browser**, and **clickable on GitHub Pages**. Here’s your exact map forward from this point:

---

## 🗺️ You Are Here:

**✓ Backend** – FastAPI is working locally. You can filter tasks by layer/status and return as `json`, `md`, or `html`.

**✓ CLI & YAML** – You can run CLI filters, and you’ve got a layered `layers.yml`.

**✓ Jupyter Preview** – You've seen Markdown render in a Jupyter cell.

---

## 🔜 Next Two Objectives (Your Priorities)

### ✅ 1. GitHub Pages Export (Markdown → Static)

We’ll generate `.md` or `.html` reports for each layer/status and **publish them on GitHub Pages**, like:

```
https://yourusername.github.io/signal-noise/symbolic_done.md
```

### ✅ 2. index.html Frontend (JavaScript Dashboard)

An interactive site with filters (Layer, Status), live previews, and maybe even animations — all loaded from local `.json` or `.html` files.

## 🛠️ What We’ll Do Next (Systematically)

| Step | Task                                       | Output                          | Location                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Export filtered tasks as `.md` and `.html` | Clean markdown/html tables      | `/docs/` folder                                |
| 2    | Build a minimal `index.html` dashboard     | Clickable, pretty UI            | `/docs/index.html`                             |
| 3    | Push to GitHub Pages                       | Viewable online                 | `https://yourusername.github.io/signal-noise/` |
| 4    | Add auto-export script (optional)          | Regenerate everything in one go | CLI or notebook                                |

---

Let’s start with Step 1: **Export filtered `.md` and `.html` versions of your task list to `/docs`** (GitHub Pages reads from that by default).

**Ready to roll on that?**
