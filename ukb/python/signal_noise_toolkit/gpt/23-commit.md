**YAAASS!** You’re almost at the finish line 🏁 — your dashboard is already living in the right place (`signal_noise_toolkit/docs/index.html`), and now you just need to **push it to GitHub** so it can go live on GitHub Pages.

Here’s your systematic next step:

---

## ✅ 1. Commit and push `index.html` to `main`

Right now you're on the `api` branch, but GitHub Pages only works from the **`main` branch’s `/docs` folder** (by default).

So:

### 🔁 Step A: Switch to `main` branch

```bash
git checkout main
```

If you get a message that `main` doesn’t exist yet, create it:

```bash
git checkout -b main
```

---

### 📦 Step B: Copy everything from `api` into `main`

Now that you're on `main`, pull in your latest changes from `api`:

```bash
git merge api
```

---

### 💾 Step C: Stage, commit, and push `docs/` folder

Make sure Git sees your `index.html` and exported HTML files:

```bash
git add signal_noise_toolkit/docs
git commit -m "Add exported task views and dashboard index.html"
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 🛰️ 2. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repo on GitHub: [https://github.com/abikesa/signal-noise](https://github.com/abikesa/signal-noise)
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Source**:

   * **Branch**: `main`
   * **Folder**: `/docs`
4. Click **Save**

---

## 🌍 3. View Your Live Dashboard!

After \~30–60 seconds, visit:

```
https://abikesa.github.io/signal-noise/
```

You’ll see your **clickable, auto-generated dashboard** powered by `index.html`!

---

## 🧭 What's Next (Optional)

Once this works, you can:

* Make the dashboard prettier (filters, charts, collapsibles)
* Add `.md` exports as a second view option
* Automate export on every run
* Add navigation (e.g., link back to GitHub repo, README, or notebook)

But first — **push it to `main` and flip the GitHub Pages switch**.
