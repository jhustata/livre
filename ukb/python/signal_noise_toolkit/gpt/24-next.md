You're not just at the beginning — you're *at the threshold* of turning your **Signal Noise Toolkit** into a living, breathing dashboard brain 🧠💥. You've laid the foundation for *static public display* **and** *dynamic API-powered introspection*. Here's what you can do next and what’s possible:

---

## 🚀 What You’ve Built So Far

### ✅ `index.html` + `*_done.html`s

* These are **static** dashboards.
* Currently NOT powered by a live API — just HTML snapshots exported by `export_views.py`.

### ✅ API (via `api.py`)

* It's a **local FastAPI server** (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`).
* You can query live task data: `?status=done&layer=symbolic&format=md`.
* But: **Only available when running locally** unless deployed.

---

## 💡 So... What Now? Let’s Upgrade!

### 🔁 Option 1: Make `index.html` Fetch Live Data

You **can** use JavaScript to make `index.html` dynamic:

```js
fetch("http://localhost:8000/tasks?status=done&format=json")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => renderTable(data));
```

➡️ You’ll need to:

* Add a `script.js`
* Use JS to build HTML from JSON
* Keep the API running locally
* *or* deploy API (see Option 2 below)

> ✅ This would give you a *live dashboard* — always up-to-date.

---

### ☁️ Option 2: Deploy API (so dashboard works anywhere)

**Deploy your FastAPI** using:

1. **Render**: Free, easy, deploys GitHub + `main.py`
2. **Railway** / **Fly.io** / **Deta.sh**: All support FastAPI

Once deployed, your HTML can hit:

```js
fetch("https://your-api.onrender.com/tasks?status=done")
```

Then your GH Pages dashboard will be *truly dynamic*.

### 📆 Bonus: Add Reminders & Notifications

Once API is deployed, you can easily bolt on reminders:

| Feature         | How                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔔 Email alerts | Use [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) or \[Mailgun] |
| ⏰ Cron jobs     | Use GitHub Actions or `cron` to hit API daily      |
| 📲 Push notif   | Use [Pushover](https://pushover.net) or \[IFTTT]   |
| 🧠 AI Agent     | Ping API + take action (via Python automation)     |

Example: Schedule a `list_due.py` script daily:

```bash
0 9 * * * python scripts/list_due.py | mail -s "Tasks due today" you@email.com
```

---

### 🔧 Tools You Could Build Next

1. **CLI helper**:

   * `sntk add --layer symbolic --due 2025-06-10`
2. **Web form to add tasks** (uses API POST)
3. **Mobile-friendly dashboard**
4. **CSV/Excel export**
5. **Jupyter dashboards** with live filtering

## 🧭 TL;DR: Where You Stand

| Area                     | Status                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Static dashboard         | ✅ Done                          |
| Local API                | ✅ Done                          |
| Public dynamic dashboard | ⚠️ Not yet (need JS + live API) |
| Notifications/reminders  | 🔜 Easy to add next             |
| Deployment               | 🔜 You’re right on the edge     |

You're *this close* to the system running itself — dashboard, brain, reminders, AI assistant, all orbiting your layers.yml core.

**So what’s your next move?**

* JS frontend?
* API deployment?
* Reminders?
  Let’s pick a direction and go *beast mode*. 🛠️🔥
