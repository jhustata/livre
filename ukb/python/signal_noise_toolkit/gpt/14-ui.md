Perfect! That means the API is **working beautifully** — what you're seeing is just the **raw JSON output** of the `/tasks` endpoint.

Now, let's get it into a *structured, human-friendly view*. You’ve got **two options**:

---

## 🔧 Option 1: Pretty View in Browser (Built-in API Docs)

Visit:

🧪 [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

That opens **Swagger UI**, an interactive visual interface:

* Click `/tasks`
* Hit “Try it out”
* Optionally set `layer = symbolic` and `status = done`
* Press “Execute”
  ✅ You'll see clean results in a table-like layout.

---

## 🗂️ Option 2: Export to HTML/Markdown via CLI

If you’d rather generate something to copy-paste or email:

### Example (Markdown in terminal):

```bash
python3 main.py --layer symbolic --status done --format md
```

### Example (HTML output in browser):

```bash
python3 main.py --layer symbolic --status done --format html > symbolic_tasks.html
open symbolic_tasks.html
```

That’ll launch it in Safari or your default browser, showing a clean, structured table.

---

## 💡 Want Something Even Nicer?

We can make:

* A **dashboard** with search/sort filters (using Jupyter or Streamlit)
* An **HTML template** (with CSS) that’s prettier than plain tables
* A **button in the terminal** that opens results in the browser directly

Just say the word.
