Ahhh yes — let me clear that up. A few quick fixes and you’ll be flying again. Here's what happened, and what to do:

## 🧠 Why `CTRL+C` failed

You **don’t literally type `CTRL+C`** — instead:

* Hold the **Control** key (`ctrl`)
* Then press the **C** key

This is a keyboard shortcut that **stops the currently running server** in your terminal. You do **not** type `CTRL+C` into the terminal.

If you didn’t start the server again yet, no worries — we’ll fix the next issue first.

## ❗ Why `uvicorn` says "command not found"

You're in a Python virtual environment (`(myenv)`), but `uvicorn` wasn’t installed in that environment.

Let’s fix that:

---

## ✅ Step-by-step Fix

### 1. Install `uvicorn` and `fastapi` in your virtual environment

Paste this:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

You should see it download and install.

---

### 2. Try running the server again

Once that finishes, paste this:

```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

If successful, it should say:

```
Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### 3. 🎉 Open your browser and check:

* [http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks](http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks)
* [http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks?format=md](http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks?format=md)
* [http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks?layer=symbolic\&format=html](http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks?layer=symbolic&format=html)

---

Let me know what you see. Once that’s smooth, we can add:

* `/layers` viewer
* export to file
* or a little notebook dashboard 🧠💻

You're right on track.
