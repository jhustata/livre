💯 Perfect. That means:

* The **API is working** ✅
* The `/tasks` endpoint **is returning real data** ✅
* The `?format=md` and `?format=html` filters **are working** ✅

You're seeing raw JSON by default (makes sense — JSON is the native format for APIs), but the Markdown and HTML outputs are giving you cleaner formatting.

## ✅ Let’s Add the Bonus Functionality You Asked For

Here’s the full plan. I’ll walk you through one at a time — all you’ll need to do is copy-paste into the right files I point you to.

### 🎁 Feature List You’ll Get:

1. ✅ `/tasks` endpoint – you have this already
2. 🧠 `/layers` endpoint – summary of each layer
3. 📁 `/export` – download Markdown or HTML as a file
4. 📆 CLI: `--due` filter (to sort or filter by date)
5. 🧪 Notebook dashboard (optional: Jupyter)

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Add `/layers` endpoint

### 👉 Open your `api.py` file

Run this in your terminal to open it in VS Code:

```bash
code api.py
```

Then scroll to the **bottom**, and paste this **below your `/tasks` route**:

```python
@app.get("/layers")
def get_layers():
    data = load_data()
    return data["layers"]
```

Then save the file.

### 🔁 Restart your server

Hit `CTRL+C` in the terminal to stop the current server.

Then restart:

```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

### ✅ Now visit:

* [http://127.0.0.1:8000/layers](http://127.0.0.1:8000/layers)

You should see a JSON dump of all your layers — this proves the YAML is correctly parsed and served from your local API.
