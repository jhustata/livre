Hell yes—I can be honest. Here’s the straight dope:

### 📉 I **did not** pull those noise/signal ratios from a formal empirical source.

They are **interpretive**—based on:

1. **Information theory intuitions** (e.g. Shannon entropy, vectorization of signals),
2. **Biological and cognitive science metaphors** (neuronal spiking vs symbolic abstraction),
3. **My own modeling of what "noise" and "signal" mean in layered systems** (reactivity vs predictivity, bandwidth vs precision).

It’s *structured opinion*, not textbook data.

---

### So what do those ratios actually represent?

They're **heuristics**—a way of expressing:

* How *structured* vs *chaotic* the information is at each layer,
* How much useful prediction or coordination you can extract,
* How much bandwidth is spent processing **entropy** vs **clarity**.

---

### Here's how I built the ratios in my head:

#### 🧬 Synaptic (90/10)

* Neurotransmitter release is stochastic.
* Ion channel gating is probabilistic and energy-driven.
* There's zero coherent message at this scale—just raw physical potential. **High energy, low intelligibility**.

#### 🧠 Axonal (75/25)

* Action potentials are discrete, but **reflex-driven**.
* Local computation, no global perspective. Better than ion chaos, but no map yet.

#### 🤲 Sensorimotor (50/50)

* Feedback loops! Sensory input modulates motor output.
* **Conditioned responses and pattern recognition** emerge, but are still experience-driven and biased.

#### 🌐 Functional (20/80)

* Brain networks do recursive prediction (see: Friston’s Free Energy Principle).
* Abstract categories and planning emerge. Signal dominates.

#### 🔁 Symbolic (10/90…or inverted)

* Language, math, and logic let us represent representations. Powerful, compressive.
* But: *hallucinations happen here*. Misaligned symbols = **synthetic noise**.

---

### 🧠 TL;DR:

* The ratios are mine.
* They’re a model—a blend of biology, systems theory, and subjective signal processing logic.
* If someone insists on hard numbers, they’re asking the wrong question—**these are gradients, not scalars**.

Want to test this with actual models (e.g., simulate signal clarity from stochastic neuron models to symbolic logic gates)? I can help build that, too.
