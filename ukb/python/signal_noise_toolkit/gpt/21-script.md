Perfect. Letâ€™s **export all filtered views as `.md` and `.html` files into a `/docs` folder** â€” this will give us the fuel for GitHub Pages and the frontend.

---

## âœ… Step 1: Create Export Script

Weâ€™ll write a Python script to:

* Load the `layers.yml`
* Filter tasks by `layer` and `status`
* Export each combo as `.md` and `.html` into the `/docs` folder

---

### ðŸ”§ Step 1A: Create the script

In your project root (`signal_noise_toolkit/`), **create a new file called `export_views.py`** and paste this in:

```python
# export_views.py

from pathlib import Path
import yaml
from tabulate import tabulate

DATA_PATH = Path(__file__).parent / "data" / "layers.yml"
DOCS_PATH = Path(__file__).parent / "docs"
DOCS_PATH.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

def load_data():
    with open(DATA_PATH, "r") as f:
        return yaml.safe_load(f)["layers"]

def filter_tasks(layers, layer=None, status=None):
    results = []
    for entry in layers:
        if layer and entry["id"] != layer:
            continue
        for task in entry.get("example_tasks", []):
            if status and task["status"] != status:
                continue
            results.append({
                "Layer": entry["name"],
                "Task": task["task"],
                "Created": task["created"],
                "Due": task["due"] or "TBD",
                "Status": task["status"]
            })
    return results

def export_all():
    layers = load_data()
    statuses = ["done", "pending"]

    for layer in layers:
        layer_id = layer["id"]
        for status in statuses:
            tasks = filter_tasks(layers, layer=layer_id, status=status)

            if tasks:
                filename_md = f"{layer_id}_{status}.md"
                filename_html = f"{layer_id}_{status}.html"

                with open(DOCS_PATH / filename_md, "w") as f_md:
                    f_md.write(tabulate(tasks, headers="keys", tablefmt="github"))

                with open(DOCS_PATH / filename_html, "w") as f_html:
                    f_html.write(tabulate(tasks, headers="keys", tablefmt="html"))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    export_all()
```

---

### ðŸ”¨ Step 1B: Run the script

In your terminal, from inside the `signal_noise_toolkit` folder:

```bash
python3 export_views.py
```

You should now have a `/docs` folder containing:

* `symbolic_done.md`
* `symbolic_pending.md`
* `perceptual_done.md`
* etc...

âœ… **Once you confirm these files are there, weâ€™ll move to Step 2: building the dashboard (index.html)**. Let me know when youâ€™ve got that sweet `/docs/*.md` and `.html` content.
