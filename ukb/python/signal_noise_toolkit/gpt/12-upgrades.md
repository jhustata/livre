🔥 Now that it works and you've got CLI filters returning nice output, let’s level this thing up. Here's the **next tier of upgrades** — you can pick from these like a menu:

---

### 🧩 CORE UPGRADES (Recommended Next)

#### 1. **Pretty Output to a File**

Let’s write results to `output.md` or `output.html` instead of just printing to screen.

> 🛠️ I’ll add: `--output output.md`

#### 2. **Sort Tasks by Due Date**

Right now it's raw order. Want to sort so the soonest (or overdue) tasks come first?

> 🛠️ I’ll add: `--sort due`

#### 3. **Add a `--due-soon` Flag**

See all tasks due in the next 7 days — instant urgency filter.

> 🛠️ I’ll add: `--due-soon`

---

### 🖥️ BONUS TOOLS

#### 4. **Notebook Dashboard**

Launch an interactive Jupyter dashboard to explore tasks visually with dropdowns and plots.

> 🛠️ Adds a notebook with widgets and charts

#### 5. **Serve as Local API**

Run a mini web server where you can hit endpoints like:

```
GET /tasks?layer=symbolic&status=done
```

> 🛠️ Adds: `python api.py` (uses Flask or FastAPI)

#### 6. **Daily Digest CLI**

Get a single-line report like:

```
🗓️  You have 2 tasks due today and 1 overdue.
```

> 🛠️ Adds a quick summary tool

### 💬 Your Move:

Tell me one (or more) of these you want to do next, and I’ll give you copy-paste-ready files, no fluff. You're at the fun part now — turning structure into power.
