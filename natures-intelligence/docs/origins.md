> 📌 *Interpretation*:

* `.md` is epistemic bedrock.
* `.yml` is operational fuel.
* `.py` is the machine logic.
* `.html` is the expressive skin.
* `.app` is the shell, launcher, or gateway.

 
**Signal Noise Toolkit File Roles**

1. **`.md` — Conceptual Mapping**
   Hosts unambiguous definitions, relationships, and meanings of concepts. It is the narrative and epistemic layer: clear, canonical, and human-readable.

2. **`.yml` — Structured Data Seat**
   Contains the raw data: layers, tasks, attributes, statuses. It is the single source of truth for structured information consumed by all other layers.

3. **`.py` — Backend Codification (Flask)**
   Translates data into logic: APIs, processing, exports. Encodes how the system *thinks* and *acts* using the YAML data.

4. **`.html` — Frontend UI Web Layer**
   Renders the interface: visualizes layers, timelines, roles. Aesthetics and interactivity reside here—what users *see* and *touch*.

5. **`.app` — Interface Wrapper (Local vs Web)**
   A launchable, wrapped experience—either local desktop-style or HTTPS-served. Bridges developer environment and end-user experience.

### ✅ Table: File Type Roles in the Signal Noise Toolkit

| File Type | Role Title                | Function                                   | Description                                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.md`     | **Conceptual Mapping**    | Define meaning, structure, narrative       | Canonical source of truth for human understanding—layer names, ethics, etc. |
| `.yml`    | **Structured Data Seat**  | Store tasks, roles, attributes             | Machine-readable and human-editable core dataset, feeding all other layers. |
| `.py`     | **Backend Codification**  | API logic, data transforms, exports        | Flask-based logic engine—turns data into endpoints, filters, and logic.     |
| `.html`   | **Frontend UI Web Layer** | Visual display, interactive dashboard      | User-facing portal; renders `.yml` data as timelines, cards, filters.       |
| `.app`    | **Interface Wrapper**     | Wraps system as local or hosted experience | Launch point (e.g., Electron or Flask app) that bridges dev and end-user.   |

Yes — that's more than reasonable. It's elegant and layered with metaphor. You're blending **file system logic** with a **biological metaphor**, which suits the ethos of the Signal Noise Toolkit beautifully.

Here’s a refined and slightly expanded version to lock in clarity without losing the poetic essence:

---

> 📌 **Interpretation (with Bio-Computational Metaphor)**

| Layer     | File Type | Function          | Biological Analogy  | Description                                              |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core**  | `.md`     | Epistemic Bedrock | 🧬 *Molecular*      | Source of meaning, code of understanding, primal signals |
| **Data**  | `.yml`    | Operational Fuel  | 🦴 *Anatomical*     | Structured form, defined parts, system layout            |
| **Logic** | `.py`     | Machine Logic     | 🫀 *Physiological*  | System functions, transformations, dynamic processes     |
| **View**  | `.html`   | Expressive Skin   | 🩻 *Integumentary*  | Interface, surface aesthetics, interactivity             |
| **Shell** | `.app`    | Launcher/Gateway  | 🏃 *Act (Embodied)* | The total body moving through context (local/web)        |

---

That last line — **`.app` as act** — is especially strong. You're capturing the embodied totality of the system *in motion*, not just as static files.

Would you like this mapped as an interactive diagram or exported into layered `.md`, `.yml`, or `.html` assets for your repo or dashboard?
