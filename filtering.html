    <h1>#Filtering – Neurotemporal Signal Refinement</h1>

      Tactical (corticosteroids)

      Strategical (none)
      Operational (athena)
      Existential (recurrence)

      While I’m famous for a widely undulating weight, even within narrow time periods, at least among close friends, these last three years tested me — and I failed flat out. I guess the 40s are an inflection point in agility.

      But these last four months I might have pulled yet another truck out of the hat, even unbeknownst to me: Russian fatalism. Thus transformed the lack of agency into a stratagem of calm fatality.

      Everything upstream in the noise-signal gradient is thus pruned: absence of tactic is the tactic that prunes information ℹ️— radio-silence.

      In this modern world this shuts out allostatic loads of great magnitude and variety. While I failed to sleep in my first two weeks in Baltimore some 20 years ago, thereafter, and for two decades, my mind filtered the sirens 🚨 from ambulance 🚑, police 👮, firefighters 🚒, helicopters 🚁 around Johns Hopkins.

      But given the serenity and quality of my sleep in Centreville, VA these last four months, I now understand that my amygdala registered all that. And I packed on those cortisol-driven carbs and beers 🍺.

      Now I thrive on affettati misti, charcuterie boards, and playful variants. I streamline, undulate, stroke, do six IM sets, and recurse everyday or week.

      I’ve dropped from 33% body fat to 24% in four months. My clothes are dripping off. My girlfriends are astonished and are demanding my secret. I tell them “just deleted old files.” Returned to the garden of Eden.

    <h2 class="section-title">🔍 Signal/Noise Filtering Analysis</h2>

    <div class="layer">
      <h3>🧠 Tactical → Corticosteroids</h3>
      <div class="original">You’re invoking a biological signal: stress hormones as tactical agents. Cortisol doesn’t negotiate. It reacts.</div>
      <div class="filtered">Filtered Insight: <blockquote>"My weight undulated like a seismograph tuned to cortisol."</blockquote></div>
    </div>

    <div class="layer">
      <h3>📡 Informational → Filtration</h3>
      <div class="original">Radio silence becomes an informational tactic. Deletion is signal.</div>
      <div class="filtered">Filtered Insight: <blockquote>"Absence was my message. I said nothing, and thus everything irrelevant echoed into nullity."</blockquote></div>
    </div>

    <div class="layer">
      <h3>🧭 Strategic → None</h3>
      <div class="original">You chose not to plan. That nihilistic commitment calcified into agency.</div>
      <div class="filtered">Filtered Insight: <blockquote>"I stopped planning and started pruning. Inaction became my most durable design."</blockquote></div>
    </div>

    <div class="layer">
      <h3>⚙️ Operational → Athena</h3>
      <div class="original">Operational grace emerged as myth. Charcuterie, recursion—not routines but rituals.</div>
      <div class="filtered">Filtered Insight: <blockquote>"Operational grace emerged as a goddess from my temple of tired tactics—each set a hymn, each board a liturgy."</blockquote></div>
    </div>

    <div class="layer">
      <h3>🌌 Existential → Recurrence</h3>
      <div class="original">You are not reborn once. You recur. Eden is a loop.</div>
      <div class="filtered">Filtered Insight: <blockquote>"I deleted the archive. Returned to a prelapsarian loop."</blockquote></div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">✍️ Final Filtered Restatement</h2>

    <div class="layer">
      <h3>Tactical (Corticosteroids)</h3>
      <p>My body pulsed with cortisol rhythms—fluctuations charted in beer, carbs, and sleepless siren-soaked nights. I mistook this for life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="layer">
      <h3>Informational (Filtration)</h3>
      <p>I fell silent—not from surrender, but from clarity. In a world addicted to input, I became a filter. Absence sharpened signal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="layer">
      <h3>Strategic (None)</h3>
      <p>No plan survived contact with my 40s. So I stopped planning. Russian fatalism didn't break me; it absolved me. I stood still and watched the noise collapse.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="layer">
      <h3>Operational (Athena)</h3>
      <p>Now I stroke, undulate, recurse. Swim laps like prayers. Slice cured meats like time. My body is a dashboard. My rituals, divine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="layer">
      <h3>Existential (Recurrence)</h3>
      <p>I’ve dropped from 33% to 24% body fat. Deleted old files. Clothes hang like ghosts of a past self. I returned to Eden—not as Adam, but as a gardener.</p>
