    "\n",
    "**Background:** \n",
    "A <u>user</u> downloads and installs a <u>system</u> of program files, mostly ado-files, which form the foundation of most of the commands \n",
    "used in Stata Programming. Using those commands and additional syntax written out sequentially in a do-file, the user creates \n",
    "well-formed instruction to Stata called a do-file script. Once the user runs this script, results are generated and displayed\n",
    "in the results window, in a graph, or in a format (`.xlsx`, `.log`, `.dta`, `.docx`, `.md`, `LaTeX`, `.html`, etc). The `.html` file format is of specific \n",
    "interest since its the pathway to self-publication. To illustrate how this may be achieved in Stata, we hereby introduce the `dyndoc`\n",
    "command. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods:** \n",
    "We created a [do-file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhustata/livre/main/filename.do) and populated it with this abstract using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) language. Anything \n",
    "in this document that is not ordinary text including `<<dd_version: 2>>`, `<<dd_do:nooutput>>`, `<</dd_do>>`, `<<dd_display: c(N)>>` is a \n",
    "[markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language#:~:text=A%20markup%20language%20is%20a,content%20to%20facilitate%20automated%20processing.). \n",
    "Results that might be numeric, string, alphanumeric, or formatted as macros are embeded at these markedup points. We then saved this \n",
    "document using the file extension .do; however, any text file extension will work (.txt, .md, .do, etc). To the `pwd` where we saved\n",
    "this text file, we added a cascading style sheet [stmarkdown.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhustata/livre/main/stmarkdown.css) and [header.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhustata/livre/main/header.txt) to enhance the aesthetic of our .html file. Finally, we typed the \n",
    "following command into the Stata command window: `dyndoc filename.do, saving(filename.html) replace`. In the key analysis, $Y  = \\beta_0   +  \\beta_1 X$, where $Y$ is life expectancy at birth in years, the outcome or dependent variable; $X$ is the country, the predictor or independent variable being tested.  \n",
