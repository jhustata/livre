  <h1>🌍 Bourdain: Our Cultural Hippocampus</h1>
  <p>The hippocampus binds together disparate sensory modalities into a coherent map of space and memory. That’s literally what Bourdain did. He transformed fragmented experience into a cohesive, transferrable human memory.</p>

  <div class="layer">
    <div class="verb">🔓 Ukuvula – To Open</div>
    <p>Bourdain opened a portal—not just to other cultures, but to our receptivity. He unlocked the empathetic potential of narrative-driven sensory experience.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="layer">
    <div class="verb">🧭 Ukuzula – To Wander</div>
    <p>Through drifting, roaming, meandering—Bourdain became a cartographer of emotional terrain. His wandering encoded spatial memory into narrative form.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="layer">
    <div class="verb">🍲 Ukusoma – To Taste/Read</div>
    <p>Eating was never just consumption. It was interpretation. A taste became a chapter. He turned food into the most poetic of sensory texts.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="layer">
    <div class="verb">👁️ Ukubona – To See/Perceive</div>
    <p>Seeing was an act of presence. He didn’t observe as outsider—he became a conduit. His gaze humanized, dignified, and amplified the people he shared meals with.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="layer">
    <div class="verb">🌱 Ukuvela – To Emerge/Become Visible</div>
    <p>The final alchemy: coherence. Through editing, voiceover, and emotional pacing, Bourdain made our memories with us. The episodes feel remembered, not just watched.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="quote">
    “He took umami—the most interpersonal of tastes—and made it narrative.”
    <em>That is what cultural hippocampal function looks like. This is the case for ukuvula, ukuzula, ukusoma, ukubona, ukuvela.</em>
