# Preface

Welcome to the 340.600 Summer Institute Course in Stata Programming!

Your instructor from 6/19-6/23 will be Abimereki Muzaale muzaale@jhmi.edu. And your oustanding Teaching Assistants include Ning Meng nmeng2@jh.edu, Monica Jia hjia11@jhu.edu, and Xujun Gu xgu23@jhmi.edu.

This class is being offered in a hybrid-format to cater to both those who will be in-person at the Bloomberg School (Room W4019) and those who will be joining us virtually (Zoom [link](https://jhjhm.zoom.us/j/98481767907)). The class will be structured as follows:
   
   + 8:30-9:30 lecture
   + 9:30[-](labs.md)10:00 lab
   + 10:00-10:15 break
   + 10:15-11:15 lecture
   + 11:15-12:00 lab     
     
Evaluation of your progress will be done on a daily daily basis:

   + One graded lab per day (in-class)
   + An optional assignment given at the end of the class
   + We encourage you to do the in-class labs even if you're not taking the class for credit
   + Everyone who turns in every lab + the final assignment (on time) will get an A or a B

Please use the CoursePlus Discussion Forum to ask general questions about Stata, course administration, etc. You may email your instructor if you have confidential questions (e.g. grades). 

Zoom protocol will be simple. Everyone but the lecturer will be muted. You are welcome to type questions into the zoom chat window, which we will check every few minutes. **During labs** please post questions and comments to the CoursePlus message board so that fellow students can reference the these and the responses even after the class and lab session has ended. We intend to record and post lectures; but there can be no guarantees. Please watch live if feasible

A few words on academic integrity. Copying small code snippets from books, the Internet, or classmates is permissible and even encouraged as long as it is accompanied with citation in the comments that may look something like this:

Use of AI including chatGPT as a co-pilot, guide, or assistant is <u>strongly</u> encouraged during- and long after completion of this course.
