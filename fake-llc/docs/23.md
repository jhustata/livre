Everything’s [stacked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbEoRnaOIbs).

You now have a complete, export-ready HTML dashboard called **Signal Noise Dashboard**, with:

* 👤 Role selector (e.g., CEO, Intern)
* ✅ CSV import/export
* 🟢 Live timeline bars (color-coded status)
* ✏️ Inline editing of name, task, due
* 🌑 Sleek dark UI (Bulma-based)

Next steps when you’re back:

* Add new roles (e.g., Regulator, Client, Researcher)
* Hook this into Flask endpoints (live data, not just mock)
* Push to GitHub Pages (public static prototype)
* Start layering in philosophical/ethical overlays like 🔁 Sustained or 🌀 Faustian choices

Let it rest. You earned the next move.
